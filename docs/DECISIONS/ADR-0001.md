# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Draft

## Context
This is a template for documenting architecture decisions in the Murray Creative project. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help us capture the context, options considered, and rationale behind important technical decisions.

## Decision
We will use this template format for all architecture decisions moving forward.

## Alternatives Considered
- No documentation of decisions
- Inline code comments only
- Wiki-based documentation
- RFC-style proposals

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear record of why decisions were made
- Context preserved for future team members
- Easier to revisit and potentially reverse decisions
- Improved team communication about technical choices

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Need to maintain and update records
- Risk of records becoming outdated

## Implementation
1. Copy this template for new ADRs
2. Number sequentially (ADR-0002, ADR-0003, etc.)
3. Store in `docs/DECISIONS/` directory
4. Reference in pull requests when making significant architectural changes

Some decisions that might warrant ADRs in this project:

- **ADR-0002**: Choice of Supabase over self-hosted PostgreSQL
- **ADR-0003**: Using Prisma ORM instead of raw SQL or other ORMs
- **ADR-0004**: Magic link authentication vs username/password
- **ADR-0005**: Row Level Security implementation approach
- **ADR-0006**: File upload strategy (Supabase Storage vs S3 vs local)

- **ADR-0008**: Mobile-first CSS approach
- **ADR-0009**: Docker containerization strategy
